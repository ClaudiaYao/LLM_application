Every pixel in a local region is adaptively encoded into one of the three statuses: bright, uncertain and dark. The hlob significance of the local region is measured by the spatial distribution of the bright and dark pixels. Interest points are extracted froem this blob significance measurement. By labeling the statuses of ternary bright, uncertain, and durk, the propused errors. Moreover, the adaptive strategy for the ternary cording. which reies on two thresholds that automatically coaverge to the median of the local region in neasurement, enables this coding to he insensitive to the image local contrast. As a result, the propused detector is invariant to illumination changes. The state-of-the-art resulits are achieved on the standard datiusets, and aso in the face recognition application.  Inder Terus--termary coding, contrast invariant, interest points, repeatability, face recognition.  ## I. INTRODUC'TION  AA well-designed interest point detector is supposed to and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion [1]. [2]. For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7]. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8]. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast.  This research was carried ous at the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at the Namyung Technological Lameraty. Singapoee. The ROSE Lab s supporied by the Naiomal Reseach Poumdaion, Prume Mmasters COftice.

(e-mail: mlochenwese gmml.com; exd-pang swna edu.sg:, ekhyapi nu edu.sg).  To address the problems caused by illumination changes particularly, image segmentation has been utilized in designing interest point detectors. Fr example, the MSER [12], [13], PCBR [14] and BPLR [15] detectors use the watershed-like segmentation algorithms to extract the image structures-However, these detectors perirmance is unsaustactory under image blurring in which the boundaries of image structures are unclear [3]. Self-dissimilarity and self-similanty of image patches are used in SUSAN [16], FAST [17] and self-similar [18] detectrs to alleviate the problems caused by lighting vaniation. In particular, the SUSAN and FAST detectors use the number of pixels that are dissimilar from that in a region eenter to detect corners. The weakness of two detectors is that they are not scale-invariant and inefhcient in detecting blob-like structures. Although local pixel variance is adopted in [i8] to estimate the self-similarly, the robustness of this detector is uncertain when there are strong abrupt changes withan the image patch.  Considering the above-mentioned limitations of existing detectors, this paper aims to develop a contrast invariant and noise resistant interest point detector. Inspired by the recent wrk on the lterative Truncated Mean (ITM) algonthms [19], [20), [21], [22], an adaptive termary coding (ATC) is propxosed to adaptively encode the pixels into bright, dark and uncertain statues. The ternary status of each pixel in a local region is detected by the dynamic thresholds that are automatically computed by the IIM algorithm. Interest points are extracted from the blob significance map that is measured by the number of bright and dark pixels. As expected, the proposed ATC shows robustness to illumination variations and is effective in dealing with cluttered structures.  ## II. THE PROPOSED INTEREST POINT DETECTOR  ## A. Prnblem Formulavion  Blobs, as shown in Fig. 1(b), are the image local structures with the majority of the bright (or dark) pixels concentrating in the center while the majority of opposite intensity resides in the penpheral region. Such property of the blob structure is preservable under various vanations. Moreover, the blob-like structures widely sread over a pictorial image. These properties make the blob-like structure suitable in anchoring the local descriptor [23], [9] under various image conditions. Hence, a lot of works have been proposed to extract blob-like structures from images [9], [12], [18], [24]. However, the linear filter based detectors, such as SIFT and SURF, are sensitive to the illumination changes. In contrast, the relative bright-dark order of pixels in a local region is more stable\"},\n",

In view of this, we propose to detect interest points using the brightdark labels of pixels.  An issue that needs to be addresed is how to differentiate and label the pixels as bright or dark ones. One way is to dichotomize the pixels into bnght and dark ones by a certain threshod, which could be set by the mean or median value of the local region. Take the image patch (shown in Fig. 1(b). as a zoom in from Fig. l(a)) as an example, the bright and dark pixels dichotomized by the median value are identitied in Fig. Iic). Mledhan is more robust to the outiers and abrupt variations than mean. However, the median-based threshold is sensitive to quantization error because of its inefficiency in suppressing this type of noise. This may lead to unreliable labelling. To solve this problem, we propxse to introduce a fuzzy label for the pixels that are not clear enough to be labelled into either bright or dark set. This results in our proposed adaptive ternary coding algorithm.  ## B. Adapvive Ternary Coding Algovitum  Instead of using one threshold to binarize the pixels into bright or dark labels, a pixel intensity margin spanned by two thresholds is proposed to ternarize the pixels, as  $$ \\\\Theta( I, \\\\lambda_{l}, \\\\lambda_{h} ) \\\\triangleq\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array} {l l l} {1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\geq~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( b r i g h t )} \\\\\\\\ {0,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ \\\\lambda_l ~ < ~ I ~ < ~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( u n c e r t a i n )} \\\\\\\\ {-1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\leq~ \\\\lambda_l ~}} & {( d a r k )} & {( 1 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right.. $$  where I is the pixel intensity value, Ar and Ah are the lower and upper bounds for the pixel ternarization. Pixel intensities that are close to the median value n a local region are labeled the uncertain ones to reduce their sensitivity to noise. Properly choosing the two thresholds is essenual in the temanzation. The two thresholds should be invariant to the illumination changes, and should be located on both sides of the median value to ensure the correctness of pixel labeling-  JEUSLIC UC LURILLIESS UE PIAEE LUcHIg- Let the half width of the margin spanned by Ay and Ah be TA = (Ah - X)/2, and the mean of Ay and An be Ax = (lh + Ay)/2. Choosing Ay and An is equivalent to choosing ra and 7,. One solution for the ternary coding is setting rn equal to the median of the local region and T, equal to some fixed threshold. However, this has two limitations: l) computing the median is time consuming and 2) a fixed threshold cannot adapt to the contrast changes. Compared to the median, the mean u of the pixel intensities in a local region is easier to be computed. By setting TA equal to the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) f of the pixel intensities from the mean a, the two thresholds Ar = A- F and Ah = A + T are located on both sides of the median [19] and invariant to the illumination changes. Moreover, by iteratively truncating the extreme samples with the ITM algonthm proposed in [19], [20], the mean of the truncated data starts from the mean and approaches to the median of the input data. Meanwhile, the MAD of the truncated data converges to zero [19], [20]. As a result, these two boundaries Ar and An computed by the ITM algorithm automaically converge to the median while keeping the median within the margin spanned by Ay and An. Therefore, this margin (as shown in Fig. I(d)) separates the pixels into bright and dark ones and tolerates noise and quantization errors. Given the advantage of the ITM filter, we propose an adaptive temary coding algorithm and a blob significance measure based on the ITM algonthm, which are nrncantad e fnllmve  pmoeee  Let St and Sy be the central region and the corresponding peripheral ring of a filter mask centered at (0,0). For the blob detection, here bkth S, and Sy are chosen as cirele shape, and the radius of the outside ring is v/2 times of the inner one to make the area size of these two regions the same. Two pixel sets centered at x are defined as Iy(x) = {I{x-my|m e Si} and I2(x) = {I(x - m)im e S2}, where x is the region\"}]"

In view of this, we propose to detect interest points using the brightdark labels of pixels.  An issue that needs to be addresed is how to differentiate and label the pixels as bright or dark ones. One way is to dichotomize the pixels into bnght and dark ones by a certain threshod, which could be set by the mean or median value of the local region. Take the image patch (shown in Fig. 1(b). as a zoom in from Fig. l(a)) as an example, the bright and dark pixels dichotomized by the median value are identitied in Fig. Iic). Mledhan is more robust to the outiers and abrupt variations than mean. However, the median-based threshold is sensitive to quantization error because of its inefficiency in suppressing this type of noise. This may lead to unreliable labelling. To solve this problem, we propxse to introduce a fuzzy label for the pixels that are not clear enough to be labelled into either bright or dark set. This results in our proposed adaptive ternary coding algorithm.  ## B. Adapvive Ternary Coding Algovitum  Instead of using one threshold to binarize the pixels into bright or dark labels, a pixel intensity margin spanned by two thresholds is proposed to ternarize the pixels, as  $$ \\\\Theta( I, \\\\lambda_{l}, \\\\lambda_{h} ) \\\\triangleq\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array} {l l l} {1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\geq~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( b r i g h t )} \\\\\\\\ {0,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ \\\\lambda_l ~ < ~ I ~ < ~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( u n c e r t a i n )} \\\\\\\\ {-1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\leq~ \\\\lambda_l ~}} & {( d a r k )} & {( 1 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right.. $$  where I is the pixel intensity value, Ar and Ah are the lower and upper bounds for the pixel ternarization. Pixel intensities that are close to the median value n a local region are labeled the uncertain ones to reduce their sensitivity to noise. Properly choosing the two thresholds is essenual in the temanzation. The two thresholds should be invariant to the illumination changes, and should be located on both sides of the median value to ensure the correctness of pixel labeling-  JEUSLIC UC LURILLIESS UE PIAEE LUcHIg- Let the half width of the margin spanned by Ay and Ah be TA = (Ah - X)/2, and the mean of Ay and An be Ax = (lh + Ay)/2. Choosing Ay and An is equivalent to choosing ra and 7,. One solution for the ternary coding is setting rn equal to the median of the local region and T, equal to some fixed threshold. However, this has two limitations: l) computing the median is time consuming and 2) a fixed threshold cannot adapt to the contrast changes. Compared to the median, the mean u of the pixel intensities in a local region is easier to be computed. By setting TA equal to the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) f of the pixel intensities from the mean a, the two thresholds Ar = A- F and Ah = A + T are located on both sides of the median [19] and invariant to the illumination changes. Moreover, by iteratively truncating the extreme samples with the ITM algonthm proposed in [19], [20], the mean of the truncated data starts from the mean and approaches to the median of the input data. Meanwhile, the MAD of the truncated data converges to zero [19], [20]. As a result, these two boundaries Ar and An computed by the ITM algorithm automaically converge to the median while keeping the median within the margin spanned by Ay and An. Therefore, this margin (as shown in Fig. I(d)) separates the pixels into bright and dark ones and tolerates noise and quantization errors. Given the advantage of the ITM filter, we propose an adaptive temary coding algorithm and a blob significance measure based on the ITM algonthm, which are nrncantad e fnllmve  pmoeee  Let St and Sy be the central region and the corresponding peripheral ring of a filter mask centered at (0,0). For the blob detection, here bkth S, and Sy are chosen as cirele shape, and the radius of the outside ring is v/2 times of the inner one to make the area size of these two regions the same. Two pixel sets centered at x are defined as Iy(x) = {I{x-my|m e Si} and I2(x) = {I(x - m)im e S2}, where x is the region\",\n          \"TABLE II  ![](figures/0-1-FIGURE.jpg)  TABLE W RECOGNITION RATE ON AR.GT, ORL AND FERET DATABASES.  ![](figures/0-3-FIGURE.jpg)  and geometric verification with Hough transform, is described in [9].  Four standard face recognition databases, including AR [31], GT [32], ORL (33] and FERET [34], are used to evaluate these detectors. The database setting is shown in Table Il. The face images in these databases have variations in illumination, expression and poses. The recognition rate, which is the percentage of corectly identified test images from the rank-l best matched gallery, is used to measure the performance of the interest point detectors. Table IlI shows that the proposed detector achieves the highest recognition rate over the four databases. It suggests that the interest poants detected by the propnsed ATC detector are more robust and discriminative compared to others.  ## IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, an interest point detector is designed based on the adaptive ternary coding (ATC) algonthm, which is inspired by the ITM algorithm to categorize the pixels into the bright, dark and uncertain statuses. As the blob significance is measured by counting the number of bright and dark pixels. the detection result is invariant to the illumination changes. Evaluations on the Oxford dataset [26] and the complex ilumnation dataset m 27 show that the AIC detector outperforms the other five detectors in terms of repeatability under the variations caused by scale, viewpoint and llumnation changes. The advance performance of the proposed detector is also veriied in the application of face recognition.  REFERENCES  (1) R. Unnikrishnun and M.

In order to ensure that the two pixel sets Iy{x) and I,(x) have the same effect on estimating the thresholds for pixel labeling, the weighted ITM algorithm [20] is adopted to make them have equivalently equal number of pixels. The pixel numbers i1 and ng in these two sets I1(x) and Ig(x) are used to weight the pixels in Ig{x} and Iy (x), respectively. The proposed adaptive pixel ternary coding is shown in Algorithm 1.

A bright pixel is the one that is larger than the higher threshold. A dark pixel is the one that is smaller than the lower threshold- The blob structures have the attribute that the majority of bright (or dark) pixels are concentrated in the inner region while the majority of the opposite ones in the surrounding region. As a result, we measure the blob signiicance by the distnbution of the bright and dark pixels. Furst, the dominances of brightudark pixels in Sn and Sg are measured by the difference of the numbers of bright and dark pixels in the corresponding region. The bight and dark pixels are respeciwely labeled as 1 and -1 by (1) and the uncertain pixels are labeled as 0. Therefore, the normalized dominance of the bright/dark pixels in S1 and S2 are n Z O(I1(x), (k},A.(&)) and E9(I(x}, A{k), Ah(k)). respectively, where Au(k) and An(k) are the lower and upper bounds in the kth iteration. Second, these two parts are linearly combined as the blob significance in the kth iteration:  $$ \\\\begin{aligned} {B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k )} & {{}=\\\\frac{1} {n_{1}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{1} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) )} \\\\\\\\ {} & {{}-\\\\frac{1} {n_{2}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{2} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) ). \\\\qquad\\\\quad( 2 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} $$  From Algorithm 1 it is seen that the margin between the lower and upper bounds equals 2ry- It monotonically decreases to zero by increasing the number of iterations [20]. In the first few iterations, the margin is large as only few extreme samples are truncated by the ITM algorithm. By increasing the number of iterations, both the lower and higher thresholds econverge to the median value of the local region. As a result, the margin between these two thresholds reduces. Therefore, the number of pixels categorized into the intermediate group decreases. The blob significance B(x, k) (shown in Fig. 1(e)) is a function of the number of iterations A. The maximum value of |B{x, k)| over k is selected as the blob significance map for interest point detection, defined as  $$ B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) \\\\triangleq B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) {\\\\mathrm{~ w i t h ~}} k=\\\\operatorname{a r g m a x}_{k} ( | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | ). \\\\qquad( 3 ) $$  However, exhaustiwely searching the global peaks over all iterations is time-consuming. The following stopping criterions are used to allow that the global maximum value is achieved in most cases within a reasonable number of iterations.  Let I(x) = I{x) U Ig(x), the corresponding weight set be w = 1t2,.., 2g 1, .mn,y and the two sets separaed by n. lineews tine  the weighted mean prw be In{x) {I,|l, e I(x),.I, > uel and Ir(x} = {I,|I. e I(x),I, S Auw}- Let wn, and aur denote the summation of the weights of In(x) and Ir(x), respectively. One stopping criterion [20], which enables the truncated mean to be close to the weighted median, is to meet the condition  $$ C_{1} : | w_{h}-w_{l} | \\\\leq\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{n_{1}, n_{2} \\\\}. \\\\tag* {( 4 )} $$  In some cases, after Ch is met, the amplitude of the blob significance B(x, A) still increases because the number of pixels with uncertain status is still large. Therefore, an aditional constrain is applied:  $$ C_{2} : | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | \\\\leq| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k-1 ) |. \\\\tag* {( 5 )} $$  The third condition is to limit the maximum number of iterations as  $$ C_{3} : k \\\\geq2 \\\\sqrt{n}, \\\\hspace{1. 0 i n} ( 6 ) $$  which is chosen from experiment. The truncating procedure of in Algwithm l is teminated if the following conditions is satisfied, as  $$ C_{d} : ( C_{1} \\\\wedge C_{2} ) \\\\lor C_{3}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad( 7 ) $$  From (2) we find that the blob significance value B(x) is within the range -2, 2. For a bright region, B{x) > 0. The maximum value of its blob signitieance is 2. Similarly, a local region is dark if B{x) < 0 and the minimum value of its blob significance is -2.  ## C. The Pnpsed ATC Deteetor  l) Ridge and Ealge Suppressiowt: Interest points are extracted by detecting the local peaks from the blob significance map (3). In order to suppress the unreliable points detected on ridges and edges, the ratio  $$ r={\\\\frac{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) |-\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}} {\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}}} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ ( 8 ) $$  is used. Small r means that the peak value is quite similar to that in its surrounding regions. We remove such candidates if r < 0.05, which is chosen empirically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In view of this, we propose to detect interest points using the brightdark labels of pixels.  An issue that needs to be addresed is how to differentiate and label the pixels as bright or dark ones. One way is to dichotomize the pixels into bnght and dark ones by a certain threshod, which could be set by the mean or median value of the local region. Take the image patch (shown in Fig. 1(b). as a zoom in from Fig. l(a)) as an example, the bright and dark pixels dichotomized by the median value are identitied in Fig. Iic). Mledhan is more robust to the outiers and abrupt variations than mean. However, the median-based threshold is sensitive to quantization error because of its inefficiency in suppressing this type of noise. This may lead to unreliable labelling. To solve this problem, we propxse to introduce a fuzzy label for the pixels that are not clear enough to be labelled into either bright or dark set. This results in our proposed adaptive ternary coding algorithm.  ## B. Adapvive Ternary Coding Algovitum  Instead of using one threshold to binarize the pixels into bright or dark labels, a pixel intensity margin spanned by two thresholds is proposed to ternarize the pixels, as  $$ \\\\Theta( I, \\\\lambda_{l}, \\\\lambda_{h} ) \\\\triangleq\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array} {l l l} {1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\geq~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( b r i g h t )} \\\\\\\\ {0,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ \\\\lambda_l ~ < ~ I ~ < ~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( u n c e r t a i n )} \\\\\\\\ {-1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\leq~ \\\\lambda_l ~}} & {( d a r k )} & {( 1 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right.. $$  where I is the pixel intensity value, Ar and Ah are the lower and upper bounds for the pixel ternarization. Pixel intensities that are close to the median value n a local region are labeled the uncertain ones to reduce their sensitivity to noise. Properly choosing the two thresholds is essenual in the temanzation. The two thresholds should be invariant to the illumination changes, and should be located on both sides of the median value to ensure the correctness of pixel labeling-  JEUSLIC UC LURILLIESS UE PIAEE LUcHIg- Let the half width of the margin spanned by Ay and Ah be TA = (Ah - X)/2, and the mean of Ay and An be Ax = (lh + Ay)/2. Choosing Ay and An is equivalent to choosing ra and 7,. One solution for the ternary coding is setting rn equal to the median of the local region and T, equal to some fixed threshold. However, this has two limitations: l) computing the median is time consuming and 2) a fixed threshold cannot adapt to the contrast changes. Compared to the median, the mean u of the pixel intensities in a local region is easier to be computed. By setting TA equal to the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) f of the pixel intensities from the mean a, the two thresholds Ar = A- F and Ah = A + T are located on both sides of the median [19] and invariant to the illumination changes. Moreover, by iteratively truncating the extreme samples with the ITM algonthm proposed in [19], [20], the mean of the truncated data starts from the mean and approaches to the median of the input data. Meanwhile, the MAD of the truncated data converges to zero [19], [20]. As a result, these two boundaries Ar and An computed by the ITM algorithm automaically converge to the median while keeping the median within the margin spanned by Ay and An. Therefore, this margin (as shown in Fig. I(d)) separates the pixels into bright and dark ones and tolerates noise and quantization errors. Given the advantage of the ITM filter, we propose an adaptive temary coding algorithm and a blob significance measure based on the ITM algonthm, which are nrncantad e fnllmve  pmoeee  Let St and Sy be the central region and the corresponding peripheral ring of a filter mask centered at (0,0). For the blob detection, here bkth S, and Sy are chosen as cirele shape, and the radius of the outside ring is v/2 times of the inner one to make the area size of these two regions the same. Two pixel sets centered at x are defined as Iy(x) = {I{x-my|m e Si} and I2(x) = {I(x - m)im e S2}, where x is the region\",\n          \"TABLE II  ![](figures/0-1-FIGURE.jpg)  TABLE W RECOGNITION RATE ON AR.GT, ORL AND FERET DATABASES.  ![](figures/0-3-FIGURE.jpg)  and geometric verification with Hough transform, is described in [9].  Four standard face recognition databases, including AR [31], GT [32], ORL (33] and FERET [34], are used to evaluate these detectors. The database setting is shown in Table Il. The face images in these databases have variations in illumination, expression and poses. The recognition rate, which is the percentage of corectly identified test images from the rank-l best matched gallery, is used to measure the performance of the interest point detectors. Table IlI shows that the proposed detector achieves the highest recognition rate over the four databases. It suggests that the interest poants detected by the propnsed ATC detector are more robust and discriminative compared to others.  ## IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, an interest point detector is designed based on the adaptive ternary coding (ATC) algonthm, which is inspired by the ITM algorithm to categorize the pixels into the bright, dark and uncertain statuses. As the blob significance is measured by counting the number of bright and dark pixels. the detection result is invariant to the illumination changes. Evaluations on the Oxford dataset [26] and the complex ilumnation dataset m 27 show that the AIC detector outperforms the other five detectors in terms of repeatability under the variations caused by scale, viewpoint and llumnation changes. The advance performance of the proposed detector is also veriied in the application of face recognition.  REFERENCES  (1) R. Unnikrishnun and M.

In order to ensure that the two pixel sets Iy{x) and I,(x) have the same effect on estimating the thresholds for pixel labeling, the weighted ITM algorithm [20] is adopted to make them have equivalently equal number of pixels. The pixel numbers i1 and ng in these two sets I1(x) and Ig(x) are used to weight the pixels in Ig{x} and Iy (x), respectively. The proposed adaptive pixel ternary coding is shown in Algorithm 1.

A bright pixel is the one that is larger than the higher threshold. A dark pixel is the one that is smaller than the lower threshold- The blob structures have the attribute that the majority of bright (or dark) pixels are concentrated in the inner region while the majority of the opposite ones in the surrounding region. As a result, we measure the blob signiicance by the distnbution of the bright and dark pixels. Furst, the dominances of brightudark pixels in Sn and Sg are measured by the difference of the numbers of bright and dark pixels in the corresponding region. The bight and dark pixels are respeciwely labeled as 1 and -1 by (1) and the uncertain pixels are labeled as 0. Therefore, the normalized dominance of the bright/dark pixels in S1 and S2 are n Z O(I1(x), (k},A.(&)) and E9(I(x}, A{k), Ah(k)). respectively, where Au(k) and An(k) are the lower and upper bounds in the kth iteration. Second, these two parts are linearly combined as the blob significance in the kth iteration:  $$ \\\\begin{aligned} {B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k )} & {{}=\\\\frac{1} {n_{1}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{1} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) )} \\\\\\\\ {} & {{}-\\\\frac{1} {n_{2}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{2} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) ). \\\\qquad\\\\quad( 2 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} $$  From Algorithm 1 it is seen that the margin between the lower and upper bounds equals 2ry- It monotonically decreases to zero by increasing the number of iterations [20]. In the first few iterations, the margin is large as only few extreme samples are truncated by the ITM algorithm. By increasing the number of iterations, both the lower and higher thresholds econverge to the median value of the local region. As a result, the margin between these two thresholds reduces. Therefore, the number of pixels categorized into the intermediate group decreases. The blob significance B(x, k) (shown in Fig. 1(e)) is a function of the number of iterations A. The maximum value of |B{x, k)| over k is selected as the blob significance map for interest point detection, defined as  $$ B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) \\\\triangleq B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) {\\\\mathrm{~ w i t h ~}} k=\\\\operatorname{a r g m a x}_{k} ( | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | ). \\\\qquad( 3 ) $$  However, exhaustiwely searching the global peaks over all iterations is time-consuming. The following stopping criterions are used to allow that the global maximum value is achieved in most cases within a reasonable number of iterations.  Let I(x) = I{x) U Ig(x), the corresponding weight set be w = 1t2,.., 2g 1, .mn,y and the two sets separaed by n. lineews tine  the weighted mean prw be In{x) {I,|l, e I(x),.I, > uel and Ir(x} = {I,|I. e I(x),I, S Auw}- Let wn, and aur denote the summation of the weights of In(x) and Ir(x), respectively. One stopping criterion [20], which enables the truncated mean to be close to the weighted median, is to meet the condition  $$ C_{1} : | w_{h}-w_{l} | \\\\leq\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{n_{1}, n_{2} \\\\}. \\\\tag* {( 4 )} $$  In some cases, after Ch is met, the amplitude of the blob significance B(x, A) still increases because the number of pixels with uncertain status is still large. Therefore, an aditional constrain is applied:  $$ C_{2} : | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | \\\\leq| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k-1 ) |. \\\\tag* {( 5 )} $$  The third condition is to limit the maximum number of iterations as  $$ C_{3} : k \\\\geq2 \\\\sqrt{n}, \\\\hspace{1. 0 i n} ( 6 ) $$  which is chosen from experiment. The truncating procedure of in Algwithm l is teminated if the following conditions is satisfied, as  $$ C_{d} : ( C_{1} \\\\wedge C_{2} ) \\\\lor C_{3}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad( 7 ) $$  From (2) we find that the blob significance value B(x) is within the range -2, 2. For a bright region, B{x) > 0. The maximum value of its blob signitieance is 2. Similarly, a local region is dark if B{x) < 0 and the minimum value of its blob significance is -2.  ## C. The Pnpsed ATC Deteetor  l) Ridge and Ealge Suppressiowt: Interest points are extracted by detecting the local peaks from the blob significance map (3). In order to suppress the unreliable points detected on ridges and edges, the ratio  $$ r={\\\\frac{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) |-\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}} {\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}}} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ ( 8 ) $$  is used. Small r means that the peak value is quite similar to that in its surrounding regions. We remove such candidates if r < 0.05, which is chosen empirically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page_sentence_count_spacy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 29,\n        \"max\": 87,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          32,\n          87,\n          31\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

INTRODUC'TION  AA well-designed interest point detector is supposed to and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion [1]. [2]. For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7]. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8]. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast.  This research was carried ous at the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at the Namyung Technological Lameraty. Singapoee. The ROSE Lab s supporied by the Naiomal Reseach Poumdaion, Prume Mmasters COftice. Singapee, under its IDM Futues Funding initiative und administered by the  The authosae with the School of Electrical and Electronics Pagimeering and wath Rupud-Rkch Otyect Search (KLSE) Lab, Nanyang Technclogi-cal Lwversty, 639798 Singapoee. (e-mail: mlochenwese gmml.com; exd-pang swna edu.sg:, ekhyapi nu edu.sg).  To address the problems caused by illumination changes particularly, image segmentation has been utilized in designing interest point detectors. Fr example, the MSER [12], [13], PCBR [14] and BPLR [15] detectors use the watershed-like segmentation algorithms to extract the image structures-However, these detectors perirmance is unsaustactory under image blurring in which the boundaries of image structures are unclear [3]. Self-dissimilarity and self-similanty of image patches are used in SUSAN [16], FAST [17] and self-similar [18] detectrs to alleviate the problems caused by lighting vaniation. In particular, the SUSAN and FAST detectors use the number of pixels that are dissimilar from that in a region eenter to detect corners. The weakness of two detectors is that they are not scale-invariant and inefhcient in detecting blob-like structures. Although local pixel variance is adopted in [i8] to estimate the self-similarly, the robustness of this detector is uncertain when there are strong abrupt changes withan the image patch.  Considering the above-mentioned limitations of existing detectors, this paper aims to develop a contrast invariant and noise resistant interest point detector. Inspired by the recent wrk on the lterative Truncated Mean (ITM) algonthms [19], [20), [21], [22], an adaptive termary coding (ATC) is propxosed to adaptively encode the pixels into bright, dark and uncertain statues. The ternary status of each pixel in a local region is detected by the dynamic thresholds that are automatically computed by the IIM algorithm. Interest points are extracted from the blob significance map that is measured by the number of bright and dark pixels. As expected, the proposed ATC shows robustness to illumination variations and is effective in dealing with cluttered structures.  ## II. THE PROPOSED INTEREST POINT DETECTOR  ## A. Prnblem Formulavion  Blobs, as shown in Fig. 1(b), are the image local structures with the majority of the bright (or dark) pixels concentrating in the center while the majority of opposite intensity resides in the penpheral region. Such property of the blob structure is preservable under various vanations. Moreover, the blob-like structures widely sread over a pictorial image. These properties make the blob-like structure suitable in anchoring the local descriptor [23], [9] under various image conditions. Hence, a lot of works have been proposed to extract blob-like structures from images [9], [12], [18], [24]. However, the linear filter based detectors, such as SIFT and SURF, are sensitive to the illumination changes. In contrast, the relative bright-dark order of pixels in a local region is more stable\",\n",

In view of this, we propose to detect interest points using the brightdark labels of pixels.  An issue that needs to be addresed is how to differentiate and label the pixels as bright or dark ones. One way is to dichotomize the pixels into bnght and dark ones by a certain threshod, which could be set by the mean or median value of the local region. Take the image patch (shown in Fig. 1(b). as a zoom in from Fig. l(a)) as an example, the bright and dark pixels dichotomized by the median value are identitied in Fig. Iic). Mledhan is more robust to the outiers and abrupt variations than mean. However, the median-based threshold is sensitive to quantization error because of its inefficiency in suppressing this type of noise. This may lead to unreliable labelling. To solve this problem, we propxse to introduce a fuzzy label for the pixels that are not clear enough to be labelled into either bright or dark set. This results in our proposed adaptive ternary coding algorithm.  ## B. Adapvive Ternary Coding Algovitum  Instead of using one threshold to binarize the pixels into bright or dark labels, a pixel intensity margin spanned by two thresholds is proposed to ternarize the pixels, as  $$ \\\\Theta( I, \\\\lambda_{l}, \\\\lambda_{h} ) \\\\triangleq\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array} {l l l} {1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\geq~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( b r i g h t )} \\\\\\\\ {0,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ \\\\lambda_l ~ < ~ I ~ < ~ \\\\lambda_h ~}} & {( u n c e r t a i n )} \\\\\\\\ {-1,} & {\\\\mathrm{i f ~ I \\\\leq~ \\\\lambda_l ~}} & {( d a r k )} & {( 1 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} \\\\right.. $$  where I is the pixel intensity value, Ar and Ah are the lower and upper bounds for the pixel ternarization. Pixel intensities that are close to the median value n a local region are labeled the uncertain ones to reduce their sensitivity to noise. Properly choosing the two thresholds is essenual in the temanzation. The two thresholds should be invariant to the illumination changes, and should be located on both sides of the median value to ensure the correctness of pixel labeling-  JEUSLIC UC LURILLIESS UE PIAEE LUcHIg- Let the half width of the margin spanned by Ay and Ah be TA = (Ah - X)/2, and the mean of Ay and An be Ax = (lh + Ay)/2. Choosing Ay and An is equivalent to choosing ra and 7,. One solution for the ternary coding is setting rn equal to the median of the local region and T, equal to some fixed threshold. However, this has two limitations: l) computing the median is time consuming and 2) a fixed threshold cannot adapt to the contrast changes. Compared to the median, the mean u of the pixel intensities in a local region is easier to be computed. By setting TA equal to the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) f of the pixel intensities from the mean a, the two thresholds Ar = A- F and Ah = A + T are located on both sides of the median [19] and invariant to the illumination changes. Moreover, by iteratively truncating the extreme samples with the ITM algonthm proposed in [19], [20], the mean of the truncated data starts from the mean and approaches to the median of the input data. Meanwhile, the MAD of the truncated data converges to zero [19], [20]. As a result, these two boundaries Ar and An computed by the ITM algorithm automaically converge to the median while keeping the median within the margin spanned by Ay and An. Therefore, this margin (as shown in Fig. I(d)) separates the pixels into bright and dark ones and tolerates noise and quantization errors. Given the advantage of the ITM filter, we propose an adaptive temary coding algorithm and a blob significance measure based on the ITM algonthm, which are nrncantad e fnllmve  pmoeee  Let St and Sy be the central region and the corresponding peripheral ring of a filter mask centered at (0,0). For the blob detection, here bkth S, and Sy are chosen as cirele shape, and the radius of the outside ring is v/2 times of the inner one to make the area size of these two regions the same. Two pixel sets centered at x are defined as Iy(x) = {I{x-my|m e Si} and I2(x) = {I(x - m)im e S2}, where x is the region\",\n          \"TABLE II  ![](figures/0-1-FIGURE.jpg)  TABLE W RECOGNITION RATE ON AR.GT, ORL AND FERET DATABASES.  ![](figures/0-3-FIGURE.jpg)  and geometric verification with Hough transform, is described in [9].  Four standard face recognition databases, including AR [31], GT [32], ORL (33] and FERET [34], are used to evaluate these detectors. The database setting is shown in Table Il. The face images in these databases have variations in illumination, expression and poses. The recognition rate, which is the percentage of corectly identified test images from the rank-l best matched gallery, is used to measure the performance of the interest point detectors. Table IlI shows that the proposed detector achieves the highest recognition rate over the four databases. It suggests that the interest poants detected by the propnsed ATC detector are more robust and discriminative compared to others.  ## IV. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, an interest point detector is designed based on the adaptive ternary coding (ATC) algonthm, which is inspired by the ITM algorithm to categorize the pixels into the bright, dark and uncertain statuses. As the blob significance is measured by counting the number of bright and dark pixels. the detection result is invariant to the illumination changes. Evaluations on the Oxford dataset [26] and the complex ilumnation dataset m 27 show that the AIC detector outperforms the other five detectors in terms of repeatability under the variations caused by scale, viewpoint and llumnation changes. The advance performance of the proposed detector is also veriied in the application of face recognition.  REFERENCES  (1) R. Unnikrishnun and M.

In order to ensure that the two pixel sets Iy{x) and I,(x) have the same effect on estimating the thresholds for pixel labeling, the weighted ITM algorithm [20] is adopted to make them have equivalently equal number of pixels. The pixel numbers i1 and ng in these two sets I1(x) and Ig(x) are used to weight the pixels in Ig{x} and Iy (x), respectively. The proposed adaptive pixel ternary coding is shown in Algorithm 1.

A bright pixel is the one that is larger than the higher threshold. A dark pixel is the one that is smaller than the lower threshold- The blob structures have the attribute that the majority of bright (or dark) pixels are concentrated in the inner region while the majority of the opposite ones in the surrounding region. As a result, we measure the blob signiicance by the distnbution of the bright and dark pixels. Furst, the dominances of brightudark pixels in Sn and Sg are measured by the difference of the numbers of bright and dark pixels in the corresponding region. The bight and dark pixels are respeciwely labeled as 1 and -1 by (1) and the uncertain pixels are labeled as 0. Therefore, the normalized dominance of the bright/dark pixels in S1 and S2 are n Z O(I1(x), (k},A.(&)) and E9(I(x}, A{k), Ah(k)). respectively, where Au(k) and An(k) are the lower and upper bounds in the kth iteration. Second, these two parts are linearly combined as the blob significance in the kth iteration:  $$ \\\\begin{aligned} {B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k )} & {{}=\\\\frac{1} {n_{1}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{1} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) )} \\\\\\\\ {} & {{}-\\\\frac{1} {n_{2}} \\\\sum\\\\Theta( \\\\mathbf{I}_{2} ( \\\\mathbf{x} ), \\\\lambda_{l} ( k ), \\\\lambda_{h} ( k ) ). \\\\qquad\\\\quad( 2 )} \\\\\\\\ \\\\end{aligned} $$  From Algorithm 1 it is seen that the margin between the lower and upper bounds equals 2ry- It monotonically decreases to zero by increasing the number of iterations [20]. In the first few iterations, the margin is large as only few extreme samples are truncated by the ITM algorithm. By increasing the number of iterations, both the lower and higher thresholds econverge to the median value of the local region. As a result, the margin between these two thresholds reduces. Therefore, the number of pixels categorized into the intermediate group decreases. The blob significance B(x, k) (shown in Fig. 1(e)) is a function of the number of iterations A. The maximum value of |B{x, k)| over k is selected as the blob significance map for interest point detection, defined as  $$ B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) \\\\triangleq B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) {\\\\mathrm{~ w i t h ~}} k=\\\\operatorname{a r g m a x}_{k} ( | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | ). \\\\qquad( 3 ) $$  However, exhaustiwely searching the global peaks over all iterations is time-consuming. The following stopping criterions are used to allow that the global maximum value is achieved in most cases within a reasonable number of iterations.  Let I(x) = I{x) U Ig(x), the corresponding weight set be w = 1t2,.., 2g 1, .mn,y and the two sets separaed by n. lineews tine  the weighted mean prw be In{x) {I,|l, e I(x),.I, > uel and Ir(x} = {I,|I. e I(x),I, S Auw}- Let wn, and aur denote the summation of the weights of In(x) and Ir(x), respectively. One stopping criterion [20], which enables the truncated mean to be close to the weighted median, is to meet the condition  $$ C_{1} : | w_{h}-w_{l} | \\\\leq\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{n_{1}, n_{2} \\\\}. \\\\tag* {( 4 )} $$  In some cases, after Ch is met, the amplitude of the blob significance B(x, A) still increases because the number of pixels with uncertain status is still large. Therefore, an aditional constrain is applied:  $$ C_{2} : | B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k ) | \\\\leq| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}, k-1 ) |. \\\\tag* {( 5 )} $$  The third condition is to limit the maximum number of iterations as  $$ C_{3} : k \\\\geq2 \\\\sqrt{n}, \\\\hspace{1. 0 i n} ( 6 ) $$  which is chosen from experiment. The truncating procedure of in Algwithm l is teminated if the following conditions is satisfied, as  $$ C_{d} : ( C_{1} \\\\wedge C_{2} ) \\\\lor C_{3}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad( 7 ) $$  From (2) we find that the blob significance value B(x) is within the range -2, 2. For a bright region, B{x) > 0. The maximum value of its blob signitieance is 2. Similarly, a local region is dark if B{x) < 0 and the minimum value of its blob significance is -2.  ## C. The Pnpsed ATC Deteetor  l) Ridge and Ealge Suppressiowt: Interest points are extracted by detecting the local peaks from the blob significance map (3). In order to suppress the unreliable points detected on ridges and edges, the ratio  $$ r={\\\\frac{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x} ) |-\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}} {\\\\operatorname* {m a x} \\\\{| B ( \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{m} ) | | \\\\mathbf{m} \\\\in S_{2} \\\\}}} \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ \\\\ ( 8 ) $$  is used. Small r means that the peak value is quite similar to that in its surrounding regions. We remove such candidates if r < 0.05, which is chosen empirically.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentences\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"page_sentence_count_spacy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 24,\n        \"min\": 29,\n        \"max\": 87,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          32,\n          87,\n          31\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentence_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 9,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4,\n          9,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

INTRODUC'TION AA well-designed interest point detector is supposed to and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion [1]. [2].. For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7].. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8].. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast. This research was carried ous at the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at the Namyung Technological Lameraty.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_char_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 541,\n        \"min\": 196,\n        \"max\": 1613,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 77,\n        \"min\": 32,\n        \"max\": 231,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          192\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_token_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 135.43663186154623,\n        \"min\": 49.0,\n        \"max\": 403.25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          326.75\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Every pixel in a local region is adaptively encoded into one of the three statuses: bright, uncertain and dark. The hlob significance of the local region is measured by the spatial distribution of the bright and dark pixels. Interest points are extracted froem this blob significance measurement. By labeling the statuses of ternary bright, uncertain, and durk, the propused errors. Moreover, the adaptive strategy for the ternary cording.which reies on two thresholds that automatically coaverge to the median of the local region in neasurement, enables this coding to he insensitive to the image local contrast. As a result, the propused detector is invariant to illumination changes. The state-of-the-art resulits are achieved on the standard datiusets, and aso in the face recognition application.

For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7].. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8].. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast. This research was carried ous at the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at the Namyung Technological Lameraty.\",\n",

INTRODUC'TION AA well-designed interest point detector is supposed to and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion [1]. [2].. For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7].. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8].. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast. This research was carried ous at the Rapid-Rich Object Search (ROSE) Lab at the Namyung Technological Lameraty.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_char_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 541,\n        \"min\": 196,\n        \"max\": 1613,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1307\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 77,\n        \"min\": 32,\n        \"max\": 231,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          192\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunk_token_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 135.43663186154623,\n        \"min\": 49.0,\n        \"max\": 403.25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          326.75\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Every pixel in a local region is adaptively encoded into one of the three statuses: bright, uncertain and dark. The hlob significance of the local region is measured by the spatial distribution of the bright and dark pixels. Interest points are extracted froem this blob significance measurement. By labeling the statuses of ternary bright, uncertain, and durk, the propused errors. Moreover, the adaptive strategy for the ternary cording.which reies on two thresholds that automatically coaverge to the median of the local region in neasurement, enables this coding to he insensitive to the image local contrast. As a result, the propused detector is invariant to illumination changes. The state-of-the-art resulits are achieved on the standard datiusets, and aso in the face recognition application.

INTRODUC'TION AA well-designed interest point detector is supposed to and viewpoint changes, clutter background and occlusion [1]. [2].. For years, interest point detectors have been extensively studied and widely used in many applications [3], [4], [5], 6]. [7].. Nevertheless, an open question remains about extracting the stable points under illumination vanations. The Hessian-Laplace/Affine (8], Harris-Laplace/Afine [8].. SIFT [9] and SURF (IO detectws are uilt upon the derivatives of the Gaussian filter. Either the first or the second derivative of the Gaussian filter is used to compute the strength of the image lacal contrast. As the Gaussian filter responds proportionally to the image local contrast, these detectors perform porly in detecing low contrast structures even if these structures are stable under different variations and significant in computer vision applications. Moreover, these detectors are susceptible to abrupt structures and image noises. To mitigate the influece caused by image noise and nearby image structures, a rank-ordered Laplacian of Gaussian filter is proposed in [ll]. However, such a detector still partial relies on the image local eontrast.

So if it's available and the model is supported (not all models support Flash Attention 2), we'll use it.

Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes.

            "- milk is the best source to fulfill nutritional requirements. An exclusively breastfed infant does not even need extra water, including in hot climates. A newborn infant (birth to 28 days) requires feedings eight to twelve times a day or more. Between 1 and 3 months of age, the breastfed infant becomes more efficient, and the number of feedings per day often become fewer even though the amount of milk consumed stays the same. After about six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to help meet nutrient needs. Foods that are added in addition to breastmilk are called complementary foods. Complementary foods should be nutrient dense to provide optimal nutrition. Complementary foods include baby meats, vegetables, fruits, infant cereal, and dairy products such as yogurt, but not infant formula. Infant formula is a substitute, not a complement to breastmilk. In addition to complementary foods, the World Health Organization recommends that breastfeeding continue up to 2 years of age or beyond, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends at least one year of breastfeeding, or longer.\n",
            "- Most mothers can make enough milk for their babies whether they have small or large breasts. It is normal for a woman to have one breast that is different than the other in size or shape. During pregnancy, the breasts will normally increase in size. If a woman does not notice any changes to her breast during pregnancy, she should discuss this with her healthcare provider or a lactation consultant. After the birth of the baby, nutritional needs must be met to ensure that an infant not only survives, but thrives from infancy into childhood. Breastfeeding provides the fuel a newborn needs for rapid growth and development. As a result, the WHO recommends that breastfeeding is exclusive (no other food or drink) for the first six months of an infant’s life. Exclusive breastfeeding is one of the best ways a mother can support the growth and protect the health of her infant child. Breast milk contains nearly all of the nutrients that a newborn requires and gives a child the best start to a healthy life. Most women want to breastfeed their babies; in the US, over 80% of women start to breastfeed their infants.\n",

All employers are to required to allow breastfeeding mothers adequate break time to pump or nurse in location other than a bathroom.

Members of a community can also promote and support breastfeeding. New mothers can join peer counseling groups or turn to other women within their community who have previous experience with breastfeeding. In addition, community-based programs can provide education and support. The US Department of Agriculture’s Women, Infants, and Children program provides information on breastfeeding and both professional and peer support for women and their babies from low-income families. Launched in 2004, the Loving Support program combines peer counseling with breastfeeding promotion efforts to increase 7. Hawaiʻi State Judiciary. (2020).\n",
            "- is making sure that children receive an adequate amount of needed nutrients to provide a strong foundation for the rest of their lives. Most expectant mothers begin thinking about how they will feed their baby early in their pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to offer breastfeeding education and support starting with the first prenatal appointment. Support from family members, especially the baby’s father and grandmother, plus friends, employers, and others can greatly help with both the decision-making process during pregnancy and the beginning and maintenance of breastfeeding after the baby’s birth. In the United States, about 83.2 percent of babies start out being breastfed.1 Yet by the age of six months, when solid foods should begin to be introduced into a child’s diet along with breast milk, only about 25 percent of infants in the United States were still breastfed exclusively, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).2 The approval and assistance of family members, friends, employers, health-care providers, and policymakers can make an enormous difference and provide the needed promotion and support for mothers who wish to breastfeed their children. Education about breastfeeding typically begins with health-care providers. During prenatal care and often soon after a woman has given birth, doctors, nurses, and other clinicians can explain the benefits of breastfeeding and describe the proper technique. Nearly all births in the United States and Canada occur in hospital settings, and hospital practices in labor, delivery, postpartum care, and discharge planning can inform and support women who want to 1.

            "- caloric content in breast milk is made up of fat. A high-fat diet that includes cholesterol is necessary to support the development of neural pathways in the brain and throughout the body. However, saturated fats and trans fatty acids inhibit this growth. Infants who are over the age of six months, which means they are receiving complementary foods, should not consume foods that are high in these types of fats. The RDA (AI) for total fat is 30 grams per day for infants 0-6 months old and 31 grams per day for infants 7-12 months old. Micronutrients Almost all of the nutrients that infants require during the first 6 months can be met if they consume an adequate amount of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Unless the mother is taking a large dose of Vitamin D, human milk will be low in vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Therefore, breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. Infants at the highest risk for vitamin D deficiency are those with darker skin and little to no exposure to sunlight, and infants born prematurely.\n",

The energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical energy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of food energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for “calories” is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A kilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small “c”) is synonymous with the “Calorie” (with a capital “C”) on nutrition food labels.

Water does not contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water. More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of water per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for life’s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely important, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 “Minerals and Their Major Functions” and Table 1.2 “Vitamins and Their Major Functions” for a complete list and their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients are not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as cofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).',\n",

Amino acids are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant- based foods, most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning “of primary importance,” which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known colloquially as the “workhorses” of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram; however providing energy is not protein’s most important function. Proteins provide structure to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that take place in the body. Scientists estimate that greater than one-hundred thousand different proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make thousands of specific proteins.

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction',\n",
